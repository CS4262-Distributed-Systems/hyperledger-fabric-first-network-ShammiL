## Blockchain Concepts Learned

1. Blockchain Technology
    * A chain of blocks in which each block is formed by a page in a ledger.
    * A block contains the block-hash of the previous block creating a tie between the blocks which results in a chain of blocks
    * A block also contains a Merkle tree which has the transactions of the block in its leaves.
    
2. Proof-of-Work (PoF)
    * Is a consensus algorithm used in blockchain networks. eg: Bitcoin
    * Believe the 1st one to solve a given puzzle. eg: find a nonce that create a block-hash containing 19 leading zeros.
